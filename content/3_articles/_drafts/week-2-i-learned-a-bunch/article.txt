They like to complete little task for a small reward, while working towards a bigger goal. Also, we've concluded that the social circle of these students are of utmost importance when it comes to the physiscal and mental health.",

They will be rewarded with point, and every student using the app can participate to become the best of the week. We've included a feature which is 'events'. This included gathering of students where they can learn, share and take on challenges together. To attract students to the app, we will start with one event. An interactive intervention that would 1) Make students aware of sustainability and how they can contribute, and 2) Introduce the students to the idea of challenges and rewards that would be the key for the app.",

After writing a basic story, I asked student in a co-creation session to make a word web of what comes to mind when hearing the words 'control room' and sketches or images of their ideal escape room. With these informaition, I created a paper prototype of the room for feedback from teachers, students and the client.",

I built a set using 70 gram marker paper, hanged from sting and nylon thread suspended by bottles filled with water. Everything was cut and painted by hand. To present this low-fid prototype, I've decided to create a stop motion animation. This way I could make different parts of the prototype move, giving it a more realistic look, while being on my own.",

However, for some reason or other, something went wrong and no member of the committee is to be found.
