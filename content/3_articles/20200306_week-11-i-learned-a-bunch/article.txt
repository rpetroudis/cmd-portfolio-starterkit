To do this, I designed a research method; 'Data Cells', inspired by the information designers Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posave. This method use cells (a big square, with a smaller square inside it) to gather data. This can be done by using colors or patterns as variables, to fill in the different cells. For this research, I used colored markers.",
