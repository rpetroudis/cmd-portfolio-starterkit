Per round, one student needs to answer questions of the videos they have just seen; digital element. Correct answers will earn the team time which can be used to move containers from a miniature ship, to the deck. This action is collectively controlled by the 4 remaining students using a hydraulic crane made out of syringes; the non-digital element. This game give students insight in not only who each other is, but rather how each person perform in groups, under time pressure and possible stress. I created the map to better explain the concept. My team chose this idea because it was the most unique compared to what the others had; some version of a board game.",

This crane could only be controlled by 2 people. Another team in our studio were our test subjects in this case. We split the team in 2, and they had to move a cardboard container from point a, to point b. They were judged on speed, and control of the crane. After collecting and analyzing their feedback, we were green lit for a highfid prototype. I drew each part of the crane in Illustrator, and these were laser cut on grey cardboard. This crane had the ability to be controlled by 4 people.",
