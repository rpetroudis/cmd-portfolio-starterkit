This action is collectively controlled by the 4 remaining students using a hydraulic crane made out of syringes: the non-digital element. I created this illustration to better explain the concept.",

This crane could only be controlled by 2 people. Another team in our studio were our test subjects in this case. We split the team in 2, and they had to move a cardboard container from point a, to point b. They were judged on speed, and control of the crane. After collecting and analyzing the feedback, we were green lit for a highfid prototype. I drew each part of the crane in Illustrator, and these were laser cut, also on cardboard. This crane had the ability to be controlled by 4 people.",
