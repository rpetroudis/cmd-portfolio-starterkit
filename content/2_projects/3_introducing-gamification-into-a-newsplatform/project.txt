Because Cura\u00e7ao is such a small island, educational courses are not so diverse. Therefore, a grand majority of high school graduates emigrates abroad. In 2018, I was one of these students, together with my brother and other friends.",

That is why I volunteered to join the organisation the following year (2019). I wrote a proposal for a theme for the introduction week, Monopoly. I chose Monopoly, because you can get valuable life lessons out of the game. Three core aspects I thought would be of value for the students (based on experiences of freshmen students of my year, and myself) were; Communication, Strategy and Budgeting.",
