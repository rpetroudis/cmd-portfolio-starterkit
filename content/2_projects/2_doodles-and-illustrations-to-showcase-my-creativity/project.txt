During the exposition trial, I realized we had information on different media to showcase. Laptops, phones, posters and flyers. I found it to be too messy. Therefore I wanted to reduce the number of media used, resulting in a more cohesive experience.",

Thereafter, I needed to find a logical order to lay the information out. I created various sketchen on grid paper, in the end i chose this one.",

I aslo made a screen-recording of our app, showing the features we've added. I found an application; Artivive, which allows you to create AR simply by dropping the desired AR video and a trigger image, and I used this to make the interaction in our installation possible.",

I encountered many obstacles along the way e.g.: combination of multiple media, stirdyness of the frame, getting to know Artivive, yet it is one of the projects I'm most proud of. The making of thid installation has opened up a world of possibilities for me in the future. By frocing myself to think outside of the box, and search for new technologies, I have the possibility to create extraordinary things. When comparing this project to the first one I\u2019ve done, Kaantje boord, I can notice some decent growth. Mostly the combination of different technologies to create a final piece, usually in expositions. It reinforced my will to study this course.",
