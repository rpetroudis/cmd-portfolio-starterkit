This included gathering of students where they can learn, share and take on challenges together. To attract students to the app, we will start with one event. An interactive intervention that would 1) Make students aware of sustainability and how they can contribute, and 2) Introduce the students to the idea of challenges and rewards that would be the key for the app.",
