That\u2019s why on the age of 20, I embarked to the Netherlands, where I\u2019d study Communications &amp; Multimedia Design for one year and then continue to study Filmmaking. I am well aware that everything around me conveys its own story. And I knew since I was a child, that I want to be a storyteller. But life had other plans.",

        "content": "See, I chose Communications &amp; Multimedia Design because designing apps was something I\u2019ve done it before, without having much knowledge of the subject. But in the first year at Hogeschool Rotterdam, I realised how narrow and naive my view of the study was. As time went by my love grew for experience and interaction design.",

        "content": "I've always been fascinated by the little touchpoint that complete an experience. From the self-service checkouts in supermarkets and touchscreens in museums, to the scenic design at attraction parks such as Disney World and Universal Studios. When I found out that these were a part of multimedia design as well, I've decided that this course is what I truly want to follow. It gives me the chance of telling stories to a more personal level. Where the audience is more engaged.",

I love to work with my hands. You will see me bloom in an environment where I, with the help of constraints, have the freedom to create and be handy; where I can express myself without any limitations.",

Also, my willingness to do things perfectly has been the reason I haven't achieved certain set goals, yet. Although these are not excuses for me not to do my absolute best, I am learning to cope with these little flaws and allowing myself to fail and learn to become better.",
