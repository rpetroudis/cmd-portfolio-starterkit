I knew since I was a child, that I want to be a storyteller and wanted to pursue this dream. That\u2019s why on the age of 20, I embarked to the Netherlands.",

        "content": "Because I didn't have a clear vision of how I wanted to study storytelling, I've decided to enrol for Communications &amp; Multimedia Design. I have designed an app interface in my free time, but further I didn't have much knowledge of the area. In the first year at Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences, I realised how narrow and naive my view of the study was. As time went by my love grew for experience and interaction design.",

From touchscreens in museums, to the scenic design at attraction parks such as Disney World and Universal Studios. When I found out that these were a part of multimedia design as well, I've decided that this course is what I truly want to follow. It gives me the chance of telling stories to a more personal level. Where the audience is more engaged.",

Some of these are displayed in My Work, along with some personal projects.",

I love to work with my hands. You will see me bloom in an environment where I, with the help of constraints, have the freedom to create and be handy.",

Also, my willingness to do things perfectly has been the reason I haven't achieved certain set goals, yet. Although these are not excuses for me not to do my absolute best, I am learning to cope with these little flaws and allowing myself to fail and learn to become better.",
