That\u2019s why on the age of 20, I embarked to the Netherlands, where I\u2019d study Communications &amp; Multimedia Design for one year and then continue to study Filmmaking. But life had other plans.",

But in the first year at Hogeschool Rotterdam, I realised how narrow and naive my view of the study was. As time went by my love grew for experience and interaction design.",

From the self-scan readers in supermarkets and touchscreens in museums, to the scenic design at attraction parks such as Disney World and Universal Studios.
